16:50:25 §e[NPC] §9Gold Forger§f: §r§fDo Golden Carrots taste different than normal ones? I've actually never tried one before so I am pretty curious how they taste.
17:06:03 §e[NPC] §9Gold Forger§f: §r§fLet's taste...THIS IS DISGUSTING!!! Why would anyone waste such precious gold on this? Just like any other fancy food, expensive and gross...
17:06:13 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fAhoy, §alongfenownsheat§f! People always tell me they like ice cream, but ice never really tastes like anything for me!
17:06:33 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fYou are saying I need to combine these items with ice to have a taste? I'll believe it when I see it!
17:06:35 §e[NPC] §6Sirius§f: §r§fI've always wanted to start a farm but instead I got sucked into this life of crim...I mean business!
17:07:23 §e[NPC] §6Sirius§f: §r§fThis smell... it reminds me of my childhood when I used to pick flowers in the garden. Keep this between you and me, understand?
17:07:28 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fI once dumped a magical water bucket into the toilet. It won't stop overflowing. Anyway, you got something for me?
17:08:04 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fThanks. That should help me fix my water troubles.
17:08:06 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fI have a big problem. I lost my sense of taste, now I can't tell the difference between a melon and a cactus...
17:08:21 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fEating enough of these surely should bring back my taste memories. Thank you.
17:08:21 §e[NPC] §aOringo§f: §r§fHey, you got some wheat for my pets by any chance? Gotta keep those little monsters fed, haha!
17:08:40 §e[NPC] §aOringo§f: §r§fYou know how it is, they never stop eating haha, thank you very much!
